## Working As a Group

In this activity, we will explore how to work in a group using github. To do this, you will choose a few people and work together to write the out the lyrics to the song "The Itsy Bitsy Spider" (no more than 3 per team, please have at least 2 members).

### To start:

Please start by creating a repo for your team.  Do the following:

* One member goes to the link: [workshop activity 3](https://classroom.github.com/g/aXQgeqz3)
* Click it and create a name for your team in the process
* Other members of the team now go to this link: [workshop activity 3](https://classroom.github.com/g/aXQgeqz3)  (yes this is same as first link)
  * at this point you should see a box with your team name, click it to join the team
* You will all now have access to a repo.  In this repo there is a readme.md file and a song.md file.
  * You will eventually write a song to your song.md file

### Issues:

Issues are a great way to track what it is that each person is suppose to do to finish the project.  We will start by creating 5 issues in the repo.

Create the issues (note you can divide this task up if you want to do it quickly and it is ok if the issue number doesn't match exactly as below, just make sure you have 5 issues).

The issues are :

Issue 1:
```
Put the title of the song into the song.md file
```

Issue 2:
```
Put the line 1 of the song into the song.md file
```

Issue 3:
```
Put line 2 of the song into the song.md file
```

Issue 4:
```
Put line 3 of the song into the song.md file
```

Issue 5:
```
Put line 4 of the song into the song.md file
```

### Assign the issues:

Decide who will do what and assign each issue to each member of the team


### Work on your own issue (github interface only)

* Create a branch named after your issue.  For example, suppose you were given issue # 1 - make a title.  You can create a branch called "issue1-addtitle".
* In that branch, add the one thing into the song.md file you were suppose to do.  NOTE: feel free to put in an error... write the wrong line of the song, misspell a word or two.  When you write code, not everything will be perfect.  Knowing how to deal with something wrong is part of the learning to use git/github.
* Issue a pull request(PR) for your issue into the master branch BUT DO NOT MERGE
* Assign another member of your team as the reviewer (try to make it so everyone gets to be reviewer for at least one issue

### Reviewing a Pull Request

* As a reviewer, your job is to decide if a user's PR should be accepted or rejected.  If the issue is resolved properly (proper line, no mistakes etc.) accept the pr and merge it into the master branch.  If it is not, comment on what is wrong but don't fix the file.  It is up to original author to fix.

### Fixing issues:

* If your PR was rejected, fix it based on reviewer feed back and comment on PR.  Note that your files are automatically updated and there is no need to reissue a PR.  Simply let reviewer know that they should look again

Repeat the Review/Fix cycle until the line is correctly placed.  

### Conflicts
* If there is a merge conflict, reviewer can reject the PR and ask author to fix conflict first. 




### Reference:

The lyrics to the song "The Itsy Bitsy Spider" are:

```
The itsy bitsy spider crawled up the water spout
Down came the rain to wash the spider out
Then came the sun that dried up all the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider crawled up the spout again
```
